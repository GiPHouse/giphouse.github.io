#### Welding Fume Assistant WebApplication
In many industries metal work and welding is applied in various production processes. During these
activities exposure to hazardous welding fumes may occur, which may result in health loss. For
example after exposure to toxic metals such as chromium-6, as has been reported by national media
over the past year (2017).

The goal of this project is to develop a web-based application for companies to estimate health  risks as a result of exposure to welding fumes. Advice on control measures and their estimated effect is also part of the scope.
