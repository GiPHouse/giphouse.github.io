## Remote School Project Papua

Remote School Project Papua is a project that supports education on West Papua, an island in eastern Indonesia with their own local     
language, Lani. The aim of the project is to support the local school with a android application that can be used on a tablet in the education. 
Through the app in combination with lessons, they are learning Indonesian and enabling them to attend higher level of education.
The teaching material and the application is based on TPR = Total Physical Response method. This means that the children will interact 
with the application though simple games with words, pictures and audios mixed with playful encouragement. The application will be installed on 
several tablets that will be transported to West Papua in July 2018.
