The Dalibre project is a personal wallet for your data. It lets the user retrieve and save data in their own personal wallet such that the user can share his data and his reputation. The dalibre app contains a backend, a frontend and a list of datasources (third party platforms). The backend has the logic of retrieving, sharing and storing the data. The frontend is a mobile cross platform (Android, iOS) user interface where the user can log in to a third party platform to connect his data or share his data and reputation.
